# COMP7607 ｜ Natural Language Processing ｜ Fall 2023
https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/comp7607-fall2023/

## Course description
Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of human language from a computational perspective. The course will be focusing on machine learning and corpus-based methods and algorithms. We will cover syntactic, semantic and discourse processing models. We will describe the use of these methods and models in applications including syntactic parsing, information extraction, statistical machine translation, dialogue systems, and summarization. This course starts with language models (LMs), which are both front and center in natural language processing (NLP), and then introduces key machine learning (ML) ideas that students should grasp (e.g. feature-based models, log-linear models and then the neural models). We will land on modern generic meaning representation methods (e.g. BERT/GPT-3) and the idea of pretraining / finetuning.

## Evaluation
We will review your work individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work. Please note that both your project output and logic will be considered for marking.

## Policy and honor code
You are free to discuss ideas and implementation details with other students. However, copying others’ codes will not help your study but jeopardize it. We will check your work against other submissions and Internet sources. It is easy to know if you did your own work or not. To be clear, we encourage you to discuss with your classmates but you MUST do your work independently and CANNOT simply copy. If plagiarism is identified, one may face serious consequences according to the Faculty and University policy.
